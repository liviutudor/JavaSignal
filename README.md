Using OS level signals in Java

Simple app showing how to use OS level signals in Linux and Unix systems to get information from an MBean.

Uses an MBean which can be queried as well via JMX but when receives a signal it dumps it as a string on console too.

Also uses OS-level signals to cleanly shut down the application.

For more details about the code and explanations, see [my blog post](http://liviutudor.com/2014/10/11/using-os-level-signals-in-java-for-monitoring/) written around this project.
